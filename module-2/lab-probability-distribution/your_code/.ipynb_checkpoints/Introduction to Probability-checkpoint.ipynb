    "# Introduction to Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Lesson Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we will cover the fundamentals of probability.\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability theory was developed in the seventeenth century to gain a better understanding of games of chance. Today these theories are the basis for data science and have many other real world applications. We will learn about the fundamentals of probability theory and apply what we have learned using Python.\n",
    "Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to learn about probability, we must first speak the language of probability.\n",
    "Sample Space\n",
    "\n",
    "Since probability is rooted in games of chance, we will use different games of chance to explain probability. When playing a game of chance, we consider the game to be an experiment with a finite number of outcomes. The list of all those possible outcomes is called the sample space.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we toss a coin, all possible outcomes are heads and tails. If we roll a die, all possible outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the Greek letter О© to denote the entire sample space of a random experiment. For the coin, we typically denote the sample space as О© = {H, T}. For the die, we denote the sample space as О© = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n",
    "Events\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create a subset of of the sample space called an event. We then enumerate all outcomes in the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can define the event that die roll is even. In this case A = {2, 4, 6}.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example is the event that a die roll is less than or equal to 2. B = {1, 2}.\n",
    "Calculating Probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating probabilities can be seen as the ratio of an event to the entire sample space. We count the number of outcomes in the event and divide them by the number of outcomes in the sample space. We denote a probability with P(Event).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the probability that we flip a coin and get heads = P(H) = 1/2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try this out in Python."
